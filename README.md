In this section we will be explore how to represent more complex data in a nested data structure.

**You will be placing all your code into the scripts.js file.**

Let's represent a relationship between two animals in our collection. Imagine that our app has a 'friendslist' on an animal's profile which lists out all of the animal's friends. Let's walk through the process together.

##### Create a Friendslist
- Create an array for the list of friends' usernames.
- Create a variable called `friends` and assign it to the empty data structure.
- Using your `animals` array, add two usernames to `friends`.
  - ensure that you are just putting the `username` value, not the entire object.
  - be careful not to use a destructive method like `pop()` that will remove the whole value from the animals array.
- Inspect your `friends` data structure. What does it look like?

##### Create a Relationships object

Imagine now that we have more than one kind of relationship in our app, we have friends and then we have romantic matches. Let's create an object to organize these different relationships!

- Create a variable called `relationships` assign it to an empty object.
- Add your `friends` data structure to the `relationships` object.
- Inspect your object. What is it's "length"?
- Create a variable called `matches` and assign it to an empty array.
- Add the `matches` array to the `relationships` object. It should look like this:
  - `relationships = { friends: ['duck', 'camel'], matches: []}`
- Using the `relationships` object, add at at least one `username` to `matches`.
  - Hint: the matches array is now nested inside the `relationships` object!
- Inspect your object. Is the `matches` array now populated with some lucky animal?
- Loop through your `animals` collection, adding the `relationships` object to each animal object. Name the property `relationships`.
  - Note: it is ok that these are all the same `relationship` object.
